# Hangman Game - Frontend

This directory contains the React frontend for the Hangman game.

## Setup

1.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    (This command requires Node.js and npm to be installed.)

## Running the Development Server

```bash
npm start
```
This will open the app in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.
The backend server (Python Flask) must be running for the game to fetch words.

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```
This creates a `build` folder with optimized static assets.
